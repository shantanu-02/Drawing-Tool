## Features and working

- #### Collaborative.

  Using Redux for state management, the drawing tool supports real-time synchronization across multiple tabs or devices. This means that any changes made on one tab will instantly appear on another tab where the same webpage is open.

- #### Stroke Size: Various sizes of stroke to enhance the design.

  Slider Control: An intuitive slider enables easy adjustment of the stroke width, providing precise control over the drawing tool.

- #### Stroke Color: Various options of colors to draw with various colors.

  A slidebar allows users to pick colors directly from their drawing, ensuring color consistency throughout the artwork.

- #### Eraser.

   Similar to the stroke size adjustment, the eraser tool also features multiple sizes. Users can choose a small eraser for fine details or a larger one for clearing bigger areas.
